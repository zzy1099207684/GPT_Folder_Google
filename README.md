How to use:
1. Batch-select conversations
   * Each item in the “Chat history” panel gains a checkbox for selection;
   * Above the list, a header appears with:

     * A “select all” checkbox that toggles every visible conversation’s checkbox and updates localStorage;
     * An ellipsis button (…) that opens a menu listing your groups;
   * Choosing a group adds all checked conversations to it and then clears the selections;

2. Manage groups
   * A “Groups” bar sits atop the history panel, with a “＋” button to create a new group;
   * Click “＋”, enter the group name in the prompt, and confirm to add it;
   * Each group’s three-dot menu offers:
     • Prompt: set a default message suffix for that group
     • Rename: change the group’s name
     • Pin/Unpin: stick or unstick the current conversation in that group
     • Delete: remove the entire group;

3. New chat within a group
   * Next to each group title is a “New chat” button (arrow icon)
   * Clicking it opens a new conversation and automatically assigns it to that group;

4. Font settings
   * Above the “Groups” bar, a “Font:” dropdown lets you switch between inherit, serif, SimSun, SimHei, Microsoft YaHei, Segoe UI, and Arial;
   * Your choice applies immediately and is saved for future sessions;
